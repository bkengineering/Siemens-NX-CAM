## Introduction of Siemens NX CAM

Siemens NX CAM helps automate NC programming and reduce cycle times with application-specific, highly effective tools. The NX CAM course teaches users how to utilize the CAM software for various machining operations, from 2.5-axis machining to 5-axis milling, enabling faster production of high-quality parts. By the end of the course, participants will gain proficiency in using NX CAD/CAM and Post Builder to model and program components for any CNC machine.

## Scope of Siemens NX CAM Course

This course is designed for individuals who are new to NX CAM, as well as employees who previously learned NX but need a quick refresher on tools and operations for their projects. Upon completion of the course, participants will be able to:

- Generate G code for operations such as Multi-Axis Milling, Planar, Contour, Hole Making, Turning, and Wire EDM.
- Understand the CAM concept and perform commonly used operations in Siemens NX independently, regardless of the version or complexity of the part.
- Generate workpieces for complex parts using NX CAM operations demonstrated in examples and exercises.
- Create toolpaths and CNC programming.
